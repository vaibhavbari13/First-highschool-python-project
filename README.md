# First-highschool-python-project

This project is created during my high school.
I named this project as "Digital workout".

It stores your data locally in your computer in the form of excel file.

Firstly it asked for "sign in" or "sign up". If you are a new then click sign up and create your account. It asked for your name, weight, height, age. It gives you your ID no. which is you use for sign in and also tell you are underweight or overweight or healthy.

It provides specific exercises and diet according to you BMI.

if you choose sign in it asked for your ID number. It welcome you with your name then it give you  two option to choose. 

First is for check your today diet by asking day name. Then its provide your diet.

Second is for exercises. it tells exercise one by one (next exercise pop up when you press enter).

then it aske for continue or exit. If you choose continue it comes back to the sign in page. If you choose exit it back to the starting page.
